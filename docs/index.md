Utilities for efficiently managing materials and other assets. These tools work with both **local assets** in the current file **and external assets** through the Asset Browser, eliminating the need to open each individual Blend file separately. Built-in **parallel processing** when working with external assets, allowing multiple assets to be processed simultaneously in the background.


### Change Node Attributes

![Change Node Attributes](images/utility_change_attribute.gif){ .img-box-top align=left }

Batch modify attributes across multiple materials. Itâ€™s useful for making consistent adjustments to properties like roughness, metallic, or any other material attribute.

Target specific nodes or socket such as: Shader Nodes, Texture Nodes, Displacement Nodes, Normal Map Nodes, Bump Nodes, Seed Sockets and change any values.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Change Material Settings

![Change Material Settings](images/change-material-settings.gif){ .img-box-top align=right }

Batch modify material settings across materials such as: Displacement Type, Eevee Backface Culling, Eevee Transparent Shadows, Eevee Render Method, Eevee Raytrace Transmission, Eevee Thickness and Viewport Display Color(Set the 'Viewport Display Color' of the material to match the 'Base Color' attribute of the main shader.)

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Replace Shader Nodes

![Replace Shader Nodes](images/utility_replace_shader_nodes.png){ .img-box align=left }

Replace existing 'Shader Editor' nodes with custom Node-Groups. It targets the main shader connected to the 'Material Output' within the material.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Find Unconnected Nodes

![Find Unconnected Nodes](images/utility_find_unconnected_nodes_example.png){ .img-box align=right }

Locate materials with unconnected nodes in your file, such as Image Texture nodes.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Find Zero Strength Nodes

![Find Zero Strength Nodes](images/utility_find_zero_strength_nodes_example.png){ .img-box align=left }


Finds nodes with critical values set to zero, which may negatively affect the appearance of your materials. You can select specific node types to check: For Normal Map and Bump nodes, it checks if 'Strength' is zero; for Displacement nodes, it verifies if 'Scale' is zero. This helps ensure that your materials function as intended.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Color Space Validator

![Color Space Validator](images/utility_color_space_validator_example.png){ .img-box align=right }

Verifies that the image textures within materials in your file are using the correct color space settings, generates reports on its findings, and provides an option to **automatically** fix any issues.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Batch Rename

![Batch Rename](images/utility_batch_rename.gif){ .img-box align=left }

This utility includes options for aligning mesh names with object names and syncing image names with file names, making it particularly useful for imported assets with inconsistent naming conventions.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Reload Images

![Reload Images](images/utility_reload_images.png){ .img-box align=right }

If you have edited any of your textures externally and the changes are not visible in Blender, use this utility to reload all images in your your file.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

### Asset Browser - Manage Asset Tags

Add or remove tags from your Assets. Select any number of Assets of any type, choose the desired tags to add, and BatchGenie will assign them to the appropriate Assets. These can be either regular tags or **Smart Tags** that apply the property of your choice to the Asset.

#### Add Tags

![Add Tags - Default](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_default.gif){ .img-box .margin-tight-vertical align=left }
![Add Tags - Object And Collection Dimensions](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_object_collection_dimensions.gif){ .img-box .margin-tight-vertical align=left }
![Add Tags - Object Triangles](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_object_triangles.gif){ .img-box .margin-tight-vertical align=left }
![Add Tags - Object vertices](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_object_vertices.gif){ .img-box .margin-tight-vertical align=left }
![Add Tags - Texture Resolution](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_material_texture_resolution.png){ .img-box .margin-tight-vertical align=left }

<div style="clear:both"></div>

#### Combine / Split Tags

![Split And Combine Tags](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_combine_split.gif){ .img-box .margin-tight-vertical align=left }

Combine or split existing tags on Assets. Combine single-word tags into a single line, separated by commas (e.g., "tag1, tag2, tag3"). The split function reverses this, separating combined tags.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

#### Remove Tags

![Remove Tags](images/utility_asset_browser_remove_tags.gif){ .img-box-top .margin-tight-vertical align=left }

Helps you remove existing tags from your assets. You can either select from a dropdown of existing tags, perform a keyword search, or target BatchGenie-applied Smart Tags for removal.

<div style="clear:both"></div>
