## :material-import:{style="color:var(--main-accent-color-red); font-size: 1.8rem;"} Importing

Importing is as simple as one click, with extensive customization available. Choose between **PBR Textures** and **Blend Files**: import texture sets from a folder as ready-to-use materials or batch import objects, collections, and materials from multiple blend files.

### :material-image-multiple:{style="color:var(--main-accent-color-red); font-size: 1.1rem;"} Importing PBR Textures

Supports for over 16 texture types, with fully automated setup for nodes, color space adjustments, and other configurations.

![Example Texture Import](images/import_example.gif){ .img-box  align=left }

#### Fast Imports

With default settings, importing a folder containing 183 different 4K and 8K texture sets (a total of 725 images and 50GB) takes under 3 seconds.

<div style="clear:left"></div>

#### Advanced Options

:material-chevron-right: The image to the right highlights many of the available options, while the paragraphs below provide brief explanations of some of the more advanced or less obvious functions.

---

##### - Replace Principled BSDF { style="margin-bottom:-0.75em;" }

Use a custom Node-Group instead of a Principled BSDF for the imported materials. Easily pick from a dropdown that shows all Node-Groups in the current blend file. This enables precise material customization during the import process.

<div class="section-box accent-blue" markdown>

## :material-tools:{style="color:var(--main-accent-color-blue); font-size: 1.8rem;"}  Batch Utilities

Utilities for efficiently managing materials and other assets. These tools work with both **local assets** in the current file **and external assets** through the Asset Browser, eliminating the need to open each individual Blend file separately. Built-in **parallel processing** when working with external assets, allowing multiple assets to be processed simultaneously in the background.


### Change Node Attributes

![Change Node Attributes](images/utility_change_attribute.gif){ .img-box-top align=left }

Batch modify attributes across multiple materials. It's useful for making consistent adjustments to properties like roughness, metallic, or any other material attribute.

Target specific nodes or socket such as: Shader Nodes, Texture Nodes, Displacement Nodes, Normal Map Nodes, Bump Nodes, Seed Sockets and change any values.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Change Material Settings

![Change Material Settings](images/utility_change-material-settings.gif){ .img-box-top align=right }

Batch modify material settings across materials such as: Displacement Type, Eevee Backface Culling, Eevee Transparent Shadows, Eevee Render Method, Eevee Raytrace Transmission, Eevee Thickness and Viewport Display Color(Set the 'Viewport Display Color' of the material to match the 'Base Color' attribute of the main shader.)

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Replace Shader Nodes

![Replace Shader Nodes](images/utility_replace_shader_nodes.png){ .img-box align=left }

Replace existing 'Shader Editor' nodes with custom Node-Groups. It targets the main shader connected to the 'Material Output' within the material.

:material-chevron-left: **Filtering:** Many utilities offer filtering options to help target the correct Assets.


<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Find Unconnected Nodes

![Find Unconnected Nodes](images/utility_find_unconnected_nodes_example.png){ .img-box align=right }

Locate materials with unconnected nodes in your file, such as Image Texture nodes.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Find Zero Strength Nodes

![Find Zero Strength Nodes](images/utility_find_zero_strength_nodes_example.png){ .img-box align=left }


Finds nodes with critical values set to zero, which may negatively affect the appearance of your materials. You can select specific node types to check: For Normal Map and Bump nodes, it checks if 'Strength' is zero; for Displacement nodes, it verifies if 'Scale' is zero. This helps ensure that your materials function as intended.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Color Space Validator

![Color Space Validator](images/utility_color_space_validator_example.png){ .img-box align=right }

Verifies that the image textures within materials in your file are using the correct color space settings, generates reports on its findings, and provides an option to **automatically** fix any issues.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Batch Rename

![Batch Rename](images/utility_batch_rename.gif){ .img-box align=left }

This utility includes options for aligning mesh names with object names and syncing image names with file names, making it particularly useful for imported assets with inconsistent naming conventions.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Reload Images

![Reload Images](images/utility_reload_images.png){ .img-box align=right }

If you have edited any of your textures externally and the changes are not visible in Blender, use this utility to reload all images in your your file.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Asset Browser - Manage Asset Tags

Add or remove tags from your Assets. Select any number of Assets of any type, choose the desired tags to add, and BatchGenie will assign them to the appropriate Assets. These can be either regular tags or **Smart Tags** that apply the property of your choice to the Asset.

#### Add Tags

![Add Tags - Default](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_default.gif){ .img-box .margin-tight-vertical align=left }
![Add Tags - Object And Collection Dimensions](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_object_collection_dimensions.gif){ .img-box .margin-tight-vertical align=left }
![Add Tags - Object Triangles](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_object_triangles.gif){ .img-box .margin-tight-vertical align=left }
![Add Tags - Object vertices](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_object_vertices.gif){ .img-box .margin-tight-vertical align=left }

<div style="clear:both"></div>

#### Combine / Split Tags

![Split And Combine Tags](images/utility_asset_browser_tag_combine_split.gif){ .img-box .margin-tight-vertical align=left }

Combine or split existing tags on Assets. Combine single-word tags into a single line, separated by commas (e.g., "tag1, tag2, tag3"). The split function reverses this, separating combined tags.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

#### Remove Tags

![Remove Tags](images/utility_asset_browser_remove_tags.gif){ .img-box-top .margin-tight-vertical align=left }

Remove existing tags from your assets. You can either select from a dropdown of existing tags, perform a keyword search, or target BatchGenie-applied Smart Tags for removal.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Asset Browser - Manage Metadata

![Manage Metadata](images/utility_asset_browser_metadata.png){ .img-box .margin-tight-vertical align=left }

Add metadata to your Assets. You can select and edit one or multiple attributes simultaneously.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

---

### Asset Browser - Move Assets

Move Assets to different Asset Catalogs to help you organize your Asset Library. Remember, BatchGenie handles **both internal and external assets**, so there's no need to open each individual Asset Blend file when moving assets around.

![Move Assets Utility](images/utility_move_assets.png){ .img-box align=left }

![Move Assets Catalog Example](images/utility_move_assets_catalog_example.png){ .img-box align=left }

- Built-in parallel processing when working with external assets, allowing multiple assets to be processed simultaneously in the background.

- **Importing**:
    - **Texture Import**:
        - Blazingly fast imports.
        - Supports both Metallic/Roughness and Specular/Glossiness workflow.
        - Supports for 16+ types of maps: Albedo, Metallic, Roughness, Gloss, Alpha, Subsurface Scattering, Specular, Transmission, Emission, Sheen Color, Normal, Bump, Ambient Occlusion, Cavity, Displacement, and PACKED & CUSTOM types.
            - Packed: ARM/ORM/RMA textures that combine AO, Roughness, and Metallic maps.

        - Automatically sets up all necessary nodes, including color space adjustments and other configurations for a smooth workflow without manual intervention. This includes detecting normal map format and adding conversion nodes if needed, as well as auto-detecting the alpha channel from the Albedo texture to use its alpha channel if available.
        - Supports all combinations of Normal, Bump & Displacement maps.
        - Flexibly adjust the strength of Normal, Bump, Displacement, Ambient Occlusion and Cavity maps during import with the added convenience of bulk updates afterwards if needed.
